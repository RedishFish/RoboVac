# RoboVac
The RoboVac is an autonomous vacuum similar to the Roomba! It provides both manual and autonomous control options. The robot was built from electronic components and 3D-printed materials. 

Below is an image of the robot without its outer shell (in its early development):

The middle rectangular box contains the fan and waste storage. Ultrasonic sensors are located on the edge, which help detect obstacles. Other components, such as a Bluetooth module, DC motors and battery packs, are also present. The purpose of this project was to provide a cheaper alternative to the Roomba for my parent.
