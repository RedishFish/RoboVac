# RoboVac
The RoboVac is an autonomous vacuum similar to the Roomba! It provides both manual and autonomous control options. The robot was built from electronic components and 3D-printed materials. 

Below is an image of the robot without its outer shell:

The middle rectangular box contains the fan and waste storage. Ultrasonic sensors are located on the edge, which help detect obstacles. Other components, such as DC motors and battery packs, are also present. The purpose of this project was to provide a cheaper alternative to Roomba for my parents: it has perfectly fit this purpose as it is still regularly used by my family! :)
